The goal of characterize is to report data driven characteristics of a
model fit that describe the model. For example:

- the number of predictors used,
- the number of terminal nodes,

and so on. These are interesting characteristics of the model that often
reflect complexity of the model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of characterize like so:

``` r
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github("topepo/characterize")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(characterize)
library(rpart)

cart_mod <- rpart(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
characterize(cart_mod)
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã— 3
#>   .metric             .estimator .estimate
#>   <chr>               <chr>          <dbl>
#> 1 num_active_features model              2
#> 2 num_term_nodes      model              3
```
